Politeness and professionalism stand out as foundational elements, emphasizing the importance of constructive communication that fosters a positive and collaborative atmosphere.\n\nIn a typical code review process at Google, the sequence unfolds as follows: An individual initiates a modification to the codebase within their workspace. Subsequently, the author generates a snapshot of the modification, comprising a patch along with a corresponding description. The author has the option to utilize this initial patch for self-review or to apply automated review comments. Following this, the modified code is sent via email to one or more reviewers. The reviewers meticulously assess the code, offering comments on the differences observed. In response to this feedback, the author adjusts the modification, creating and uploading new snapshots. Concurrently, the author engages in a dialogue with the reviewers by replying to their comments. Once the reviewers express satisfaction with the latest iteration of the modification, they signify their approval by marking it as “looks good to me” (LGTM). Subsequently, upon achieving LGTM status, the author gains the authorization to commit the modification to the codebase. However, this final stpe is contingent upon the resolution of all comments and the formal approval of the change. \n\n##### Reflection\nOne notable aspect of Googld’s code review philosophy is the recognition that the process is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different types of code reviews, from greenfield reviews to bug fixes and refactoring, require tailored approaches. The step-by-step breakdown of a typical code review at Googld offers valuable insights. From the initial creation of a snapship to the iterative feedback loop between authors and reviewers, the process is designed for thoroughness and collaboration, The final “Looks good to me” (LGTM) approval signifies not just the technical correctness but also an acknowledgement of the collaborative effort and consensus-ubilding inherent in the code review process.  \n\n##### Application on Chasten\n* Craft informative change description\n* Curate reviewer selection\n* Automate Repetitive tasks\n* Celebrate the “LGTM” Milestones.\n\n<h2 style=\"color:orange\"> Software Engineering @ Google 10: Documentation </h2>\n\n##### Summary\nThis chapter “Documentation”, deleves into the multifaceted nature of documentation, emphasizing its pivotal role in the success of engineering endeavors. \n\nDocumentation, as outlined, extends beyond standalone documentsl it ecncompasses the very fabric of code comments. The chapter stresses that quality documentation is not a mere formality but a linchpin that renders code and APIs comprehensible, reducing the likelihood of errors. Beyond this, it serves as a guiding beacon for project teams, providing clarity on design goals and team objectives. Manual processes become navigable when steps are clearly outlines, and onboarding new team members becomes an efficient process when supported by well-documented procedures. \n\n##### Reflection\nThe chapter advocates for treating documentation as code, intertwining it with the very essence of the development process. This involves establishing internal policies, placing documentation under source control, assigning clear ownership for maintenance, subjecting it to review processes for changes, tracking issues and periodically evaluating its effectiveness. \n\nThe main types of documents that software engineers are often tasked with include reference documentation (including code comments), design documents, tutorials, conceptual documentation, and landing pages. Each serves as unique purpose in the grand symphony of software development, contributing to the collaboration of engineers. \n\nThis chapter highlights the transformative impact of clear and comprehensive documentation on various facets of the development process. It underscores the notion that documentation is not an afterthought but an integral part of the development life cycle. Just as we write code, we must invest the same level and care into documenting it. \n\n##### Application on Chasten\n* Implement Documentation as Code Practices\n* Ownership and Review Processes\n* Issue tracking and Evaluation\n* Audience-centric documentation\n* Diversify Documentation Types\n\n<h2 style=\"color:orange\"> Software Engineering @ Google 11: Testing Overview </h2>\n\n##### Summary\nIn the chapter “Testing Overview” fromthe book “Software Engineering at Google”, a compelling case is made for the pivotal role of automated testing in the software development life cycle. The chapter underscores the fundamental premise that bugs, if left unchecked, can escalate in cost exponentially the later they discovered in the development process. It introduces the concept that companies equipped with robust testing practices can not only prevent bugs from reaching users but also adapt swiftly to dynamic technological landscapes, market shifts, and customer preferences. \n\nThe chater highlights the profound benefits of testing code, emphasizing that it is not merely a box to check but a strategic investment. These benefits include minimizing debugging efforts, boosting confidence in making changes, enhancing documentation, streamlining code reviews, fostering thoughtful design, and ultimately leading to high-quality releases. \n\nFurthermore, the chapter introduces the concept of code coverage, a metric measuring the proportion of feature code exercised by tests. It proposes that understanding and optimizing code coverage is essential for ensuring a thorough validation of the software, providing a quantitative measure of how much of the codebase is validated by the tests. \n\nBeyond being a quality assurance checkpoint, testing emerges as a guardian against the ripple effects on bugs and a catalyst for embracing change in the software development process. The assertion that bugs become costlier to fiz as they traverse through the development cycle underscores the strategic importance of early and comprehensive testing. This aligns with the broader theme that companies capable of faster iteration possess a competitive edge in navigating the ever-evolving realms of technology, market dynamics, and user preferences. \n\n##### Reflection\nIn essence, the “Testing Overview” chapter invites us to view testing not merely as a technical practice but as a strategic pillar for navigating the complexities of software development. By integrating robust testing practices and embracing the ever-changing nature of the development landscape, teams can not only prevent bugs but also position themselves as agile and adaptive innovators in the dynamic world of technology. \n\n##### Application on Chasten\n* Integrate Automated Testing into CI/CD Pipelines\n* Prioritize Early testing\n* Promote Code Coverage Monitoring\n\n<h2 style=\"color:orange\"> Software Engineering @ Google 12: Unit Testing </h2>\n\nThe chapter on “Unit Testing” in “Software Engineering at Google” sheds light on the significance of unit tests, their properties, and the overall approach Google taks to ensure effective testing. The key properties of unit tests highlighted include their small size, determinism, ease of wriing, and their ability to provide immediate feedback. Google recommends a balance of 80% unit tests and 20% broader-scoped tests. \n\nMaintainability is a central focus for Google in testing. The chapter stresses the importance of tests that “just work” without constant attention, preventing unnecessary drains on productivity. Four fundamental types of changes are discussed concerning test stability: pure factoring, new features, bug fixes, and behavior changes. State testing, writing clear tests, completeness, and conciseness are identified as critical aspects of achieving maintainability. The chapter concludes with a call to test behaviors rather than methods and advocates for DAMP (Descriptive And Meaningful Phrases) tests over DRY(Don’t Repeat Yourself) ones. \n\nGoogle’s approach to test classification, especially the 80/20 balance, reflects a nuanced understanding of testing strategies. The chapter’s insights into the four fundamental types of testing strategies. The chapter’s insights into the four types of changes and the importance of testing behaviors align with a proactive stance on preventing potential issues, thereby enhancing knowledge and predictability in the development process. \n\nTeams and developers can adopt the 80/20 rule for a balanced testing strategy. Prioritizing unit tests for narrow scopes allows for quick feedback loops during development. This approach can significantly reduce the likelihood of bugs escaping into production, contributing to a more robust and reliable software product. \n\n# The Fuzzing Book \n\n<h2 style=\"color:purple\"> Fuzzing Book 1: Introduction to Software Testing </h2>\n\nIn the fast-paced world of software development, ensuring the functionality of your programs is immensely important. In this chapter, we'll delve into the fundamentals of software testing.\n\n##### What does Software Testing Mean?\n\nSoftware Testing is the process of evaluating a program to identify defects and issues. The purposes of software testing are:\n* Identifying and fixing bugs early in the process\n* Ensuring that the software meets the specified requirements, behaves as expected\n* Reducing the risk of software failures in deployment.\n\n##### Testing Strategies\n\n* **Utilizing 'print()' Statement:** One of the most straightforward yet effective debugging techniques is the 'print' statements. This technique involves strategically printing relevant information that provides information into whether the program is running correctly. \n* **Automatic Test Execution and 'assert()' Statement:** By crafting comprehensive test suites with assert statements, you can systematically check if your code behaves correcly.\n* **Rounding Error: Introducing Epsilon:** Some programs make exact comparisons challengeing by having float type. To tackle this issue, the concept of \"epsilon\" is employed, determining whether two floating-point values are considered equal. Developers often check if the absolute difference between the values of floating-point numbers is less than or equal to epsilon. \n* **Generating Tests: Apply Your Test to Thousands of Inputs:** To increase confidence in your software's correctness (and also reduce the time and effort spend testing each input), consider generating tests with a wide range of inputs. \n* **Integrating Checks:** For robust and reliable code, consider integrating checks directly into your functions. You can utilize Assertions to ensure that the inputs and outputs conform to expected behavior.\n\n##### Applications on Chasten\n\nIt's a collaborative effort to ensure the software run correctly. After reading this chapter, here are some action items I suggest implementing:\n1. Avoid overconfidence in your code and acknowledge that things can go wrong.\n2. Rigorous Testing: To ensure the highest quality of your code, run as many tests as possible. \n3. Collaborate and Seek Insights: Consult with Software Quality Assurance engineer and colleagues with diverse and creative perspectives. \n\n<h2 style=\"color:purple\"> Fuzzing Book 2: Code Coverage  </h2>\n\nCode coverage is a vital aspect of software testing to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of test cases and testing efforts. \n\n##### Summary of Code Coverage\n**Code coverage** is a metric used in software testing to measure the extend to which a program's source code is executed by a set of test cases. By tracking which lines of code, branches, and conditions have been executed, it quatifies the coverage of the codebase. \n\n##### List of Testing Approaches\n\n###### Coverage Class\nThe Coverage class allows you to measure and report code coverage using a variety of its method.\n+ trace() Method: sets up code tracing by reporting data during test execution. \n+ coverage() Method: reports coverage results, indicating which parts of your code were covered. \n\n\n###### Testing Approaches\n+ Black Box Testing: This approach focuses on evaluating the functionality of software application without knowledge of its internal code and structure. Testers design test cases based on specification and requirements. The primary goal of black box testing is to ensure that the software meets its intended functionality. \n+ White Box Testing: In contrast, white-box testing involves the knowledge of internal code structure and logic. The goal of this approach is to ensure code correctness, coverage and issues related to code structure.\n+ Tracing Execution using sys.settrace(): This function allows you to set a trace of function that performs automatically to give inforamtion about certain aspect. Common parameters are \"frame\",\"event\", and \"argument\"\n+ Fuzzing Test: a testing technique that involves generating a range of random input (could be customized to be mixed character and integer) to uncover defects. \n\n###### Reflection\nAs a beginner in programming, I often found myself excited about solcing coding challenges and building software solutions. The satisfation to see my code work sometimes led me to being overconfident in the correctness of my work. After all, if the program executed without immediate errors, it must be fine, right?\nHowever, from time to time, I have been proven wrong as I began working on more complex projects. I started to realize that there was more to ensuring the quality and reliability of my code than just making it run. I discovered that power of \"nothing as such as being too careful\" with program execution and the invaluable role of code coverage. The logic I applied to solve immediate coding problems was crucial, but it was only part of the software development process. The early detection of issues helps me ensure the quality of the program.\n\n\n<h2 style=\"color:purple\"> Fuzzing Book 3: Breaking Things in Random Input </h2>\n\nFuzzing is a testing technique that involves generating a range of random input to uncover defects.\n\n\n###### Benefits of Fuzzing\nThe fuzzing code generates a diverse range of inputs and delivers them relectlessly to the target application. The goal is to stress-test the software and identify any unexpected vulnerabilities.\nFuzz testing has been identifying various issues, including buffer overflows, crashes, and security vulnerabilities. \n\n###### Fuzzer and Runner\n\nFuzzer() is responsible for delivering the diverse set of inputs to the target application. The Fuzzer can be modified to generate only number or characters.\n\n```\nimport random\ndef fuzzer(max_length: int=100, char_start: int = 32, char_range: int = 32) -> str:\n    \"\"\"A string of up to `max_length` characters in the range ['char_start','char_start'+ 'char_range']\"\"\"\n    string_length = random.randrange(0, max_length + 1)\n    out = \"\"\n    for i in range(0,string_length):\n        out += char(random.randrange(char_start,char_start+char_range))\n    return out\n```\n\nRunner() is the component responsible for executing the target application with teh generated input. It captures the program's behavisor, logs any crashes and indentifies potential vulnerabilities.\n\n###### Fuzzing External Programs\nSetting up fuzz testing for external programs allows for a comprehensive assessment of interconnected systems. This ensures that the program is thouroughly and rigorously tested, helping you uncover vulnerabilities that might go unnoticed.\n\n<h2 style=\"color:purple\"> Fuzzing Book 4: Mutation Analysis </h2>\n\nMutation analysis is a sophisticate technique, which injects artificial faults into the code and scrutinizes how test suites responds. Utilizing mutation analysis, developers gain invaluable insights into the efficacy of their tests. This blog post navigates the intricate world of mutation anlysis, revealing its principles, challenges, and real-world applications.\n\n###### Benefits of Mutation Analysis\n**Test Suit Effectiveness Assessment**\nMutation analysis evaluates the quality of the test suite by introducing artificial faults into the code. It helps developers understand how well your tests can detect these injected errors, providing insights into the thoroughness of your testing efforts\nMutation analysis can be used as an indicator of test suit effectiveness. The more mutants killed by tests, the better the test suite.\n**Identifying Weaknesses**\nBy pinpointing specific areas where your tests fail to catch mutations, mutation analysis highlights weaknesses in your code. This information is invaluable for strengthening your test cases and improving overall code quality. \n\n###### Real-World Application on Chasten Program\nIn our Chasten project, mutation analysis could be applied by purposely injecting false XPath pattern to test the analyze feature's ability to detect the bugs. \n\n<h2 style=\"color:purple\"> Fuzzing Book 5: Mutation-Based Fuzzing </h2>\nMutation-based fuzzing is a software tesing technique used to discover vulnerabilities or bugs in programs, especially in softwrae that parses complex inputs. Fuzzing involves feedding a program with a large amount of randomly generated or mutated data to trigger unexpected behavior. \n\n###### The process of mutation-based fuzzing\n1. **Input Generation** - Fuzzer general initial inputs either randomly or from existing valid inputs. These inputs can be in various formats.\n2. **Mutation** - Fuzzer mutates mutates the generated inputs to create new,slightly modified inputs. The idea is to explore different way the program approach the bugs to uncover potential vulnerabilities.\n3. **Input Execution** -The mutated inputs are fed into the target program. The program's behavior is monitored and analyzed.\n4. **Error Detection** -If the program exibits abnormal behavior, the fuzzer detects these errors and logs the input that caused the issue\n\n###### Application on Chasten\nMutation-based fuzzing can be applied to test a software tool that checks XPath expressions, like Chasten, by generating a variety of mutated XPath expressions and feeding them into the tool to uncover potential vulnerabilities.\nThe mutated inputs can start with a set of valid XPath expressions taht the software tool should accept, and then be mutated through different ways, such as delete random character, insert random characters or flip random characters. \n\n<h2 style=\"color:purple\"> Fuzzing Book 6: Fuzzing with Grammar </h2>\n\n###### Summary\nAt its core, Fuzzing with Grammar is a testing technique that involves generating and manipulating inputs based on the grammar of a programming language or data format. Unlinke traditional fuzzing, which generataes random inputs, Basic Grammar Fuzzing leverages the syntactical structure of the input data. By adhering to the defined grammar rules, this method produces inputs that are not only syntactically valid but also semantically meaningful. \nThe process begins by defining a grammar that represents the valid syntax of the target language or data format. The fuzzer then generates inputs by following the ruls outlines in the grammar. These inputs are mutated and fed into the software under test, aimimng to uncover vulnerabilities.\n\n###### Reflection\nBasic Grammar Fuzzing ensures that generated input adhere to the syntax of the target language or data format. This precision increases the likelihood of discovering vulnerabilities that are specific to the application's expected input structure.\n\n###### Application\nConsidering Chasten, applying Basic Grammar Fuzzing to the XPATH patterns might be a good idea to leverage the use of this technique. By applying Grammar fuzzing to the XPATH patters, we can include edge cases, nested queries, and unexpected combinations.\n\n<h2 style=\"color:purple\"> Fuzzing Book 7: Efficient Grammar Fuzzing </h2>\nThis chaper presents the problem with traditional method of grammar fuzzer and propose a new solution to better control and increase efficiency in the code. \n\n###### Limitaions of Simple Grammar Fuzzer\n`simple_grammar_fuzzer()` can be remarkably inefficient, especially when dealing with large grammars and complex language structures. These inefficiencies become apparent as the function has to iterate over teh generated string, searching for symbols ot expand. Additionally, controlling the output size is problematic, leading to the generation of excessively long strings even with limitations in place. \n\n###### The Three-Phase Expansion Approach\nTo address the limitation of conventional grammar fuzzing, a new approach has been developed, employing a three-phase expansion method encapsulated within a function called `expand_tree()`. \n\nThis approach significantly improves the efficiency of test generation. By organizing the expansion process into well-defined phases, the function efficiently controls the output size and enhances the speed of the test generation process. This method is able to produce smaller inputs, optimizing the testing process further. \n\n###### Application on Chasten\nFor a tool that checks XPATH expressions, applying the three-phase expansion approach would create a highly efficient testing tool. The expand_tree function can be customized to handle XPATH grammar, enabling the generation of diverse and complex XPATH expressions for testing. \nBy employing this strategy, the tool can quickly explore various parts of the grammar, ensuring comprehensive test coverage. This optimized testing approach not only improves the speed of test generatoin but also enhances the quality of the test cases produced, leading the more robust and reliable XPATH expression checking tools. \n\n<h2 style=\"color:purple\"> Fuzzing Book 8: Parcing Inputs </h2>\n\nThe chapter “Parsing Inputs” in the book “The Fuzzing Book” delves into the topic of parsing inputs, employing grammars to dissect valid seed inputs into their corresponding derivation trees. This structural representation becomes the canvas for creating new, slightly altered inputs through mutation, crossover, and recombination. \n\nA parser, as elucidated in this chapter, is the linchpin that processes structured input, transforming it into a derivation tree. From the user’s perspective, parsing involves two simple steps: initializaing the parser with a grammar and using the arser to obtain a list of derivation trees.  The chapter introduces two specific parsers-PEGParser and EarlyParser. \n\nThe PEGParser takes center stage in terms of fuzzing for generating strings. Its effectiveness stems from its inability to be re-interpreted as a CFG(Context-Free Grammar), makin git the preferred choice for parsing. On the other hand, the versatile EarlyParser can utilize any CFG to parse, providing possible derivation trees to resolve ambiguities. \n\nTo bring the knowledge from this chapter into the real world, by applying the principles of parsing inputs, we can use grammars to define the structure of valid XPATh queries. The PEGParser, with its efficacy in handling string generation, becomes a valuable asset in this scenario. We can initialize the parser with a grammar that captures the syntax rules of XPATH and use it to generate a list of derivation trees representing valid queries. \n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"color:purple\"> Fuzzing Book 9: Reducing Failure-inducing Inputs </h2>\n\n\n###### Summary\nThe chapter “Reducing Failure-inducing Inputs” in the book “The Fuzzing Book” unveils a crucial aspect of software testing and debugging. The primary focus lies on the unreliability of testing fuzzed inputs when tracing errors back to their source. The solution proposed involves breaking down inputs systematically through a process of reduction using a technique known as Delta Debugging. This method employs a binary search strategy to iteratively identify the root cause of eros, automating the process and enhancing the clarity of error sources. The chapter introduces the `DeltaDebuggingReducer` class, emphasizing its role in reducing cognitive load on programmers and aiding in the identification of duplicate issues. \n\n###### Reflection\nThe chapter sheds light on the challenges associated with traditional fuzz testing approaches and underscores the significance of efficiency input reduction techniques. The Delta Debugging method, while straightforward and intuitive, comes with its set of trade-offs. Its efficiency is notably contingent on the nature of the input data, and in some cases, it may not be the most optimal strategy. The recognition of this limitation prompts a broader reflection on the complexity of software debugging. It underscores the importance of balancing simplicity with efficiency and encourages exploration of alternative reduction strategies, such as Grammer-Based Input Reduction. \n\n###### Application on Chasten\nFor Chasten, the software specializing in analyzing Python code patterns using XPATH, we can apply some strategies derived from the chapter: \n* Implement DeltaDebugging in Chasten: This can enhance Chasten’s ability to automatically identify and isolate errors in input data, providing a clearer understanding of failure sources\n* Explore Grammar-based input Reduction: Given the limitations of Delta Debugging, consider exploring the implementation of Grammar-based Input Reduction in Chasten. This more advanced strategy may offer a more efficient means of input reduction, particularly when dealing with syntactic constrains in Python code.\n\n# The Debugging Book \n\n<h2 style=\"color:blue\"> Debugging Book 1: Introduction to Debugging </h2>\n\nDebugging is an integral part if a programmer's journey, akin to solving a complex puzzle. This chapter takesn us on a guided tour of debugging in then real world. \nThe chapter delves into a specific Python function tasked with removing HTML tags, uncovering a bug that disrupts its proper functioning. The debugging journey unfolds in a step-by-step fashion, illustrating the importance of clarity in diagnosis. The introduction of assertions as a debugging tool adds a layer of confidence in confirming hypotheses, as demonstrated through the meticulous testing of a quote-handling condition.\nThe chapter candidly acknowledges the challenges inherent in debugging, ranging from the complexity of program states to the absence of clear specifications. Understanding defects, faults, and failures becomes a detective's quest, tracing the cause-and-effect chain to unearth the root cause. Debugging is not merely about fixing errors but about unraveling the narrative of how a bug came into existence.\nAs software engineers, we glean valuable insights into the debugging process. The scientific method provides a structured approach, turning debugging into a methodical exploration rather than a haphazard pursuit. The cause-and-effect chain becomes a guiding principle for writing effective test cases, allowing us to anticipate and address potential pitfalls.\n\nArmed with the lessons from this chapter, we are empowered to approach debugging with a clear mindset. Creating hypotheses, predicting outcomes, and validating results align with the scientific method, transforming debugging from a daunting task into a strategic endeavor. The chapter serves as a roadmap, guiding developers to adopt a systematic methodology in their debugging endeavors.\n\n<h2 style=\"color:blue\"> Debugging Book 2: Tracing Executions</h2>\n\nAt the heart of tracing lies the command sys.settrace(), a tool that opens a window into a program's execution without the need for an abundance of print statements. The frame argument becomes our guide, providing insights into the current line number, variables, and even the code itself. The frame works as a snapshot of the function, revealing:\n\nframe.f_lineno: The current line number\nframe.f_locals: The current variables as a Python dictionary\nframe.f_code: The current code as a Code object, complete with attributes like frame.f_code.co_name for the function's name\n\nThe chapter demonstrates how tracing can be applied not only to functions but also to entire classes. By utilizing the with command, tracing becomes a scoped operation, capturing events only within the indented block. This flexibility enhances the efficiency of the debugging process, allowing developers to focus on specific sections of code.\nTracing isn't just about capturing everything; it's about selective observation. Conditional tracing, as showcased in the chapter, introduces a tracer that logs only when a specific conditional expression holds true. This feature enables developers to hone in on critical sections of code, reducing noise and providing a clearer picture of the program's execution.\n\n<h2 style=\"color:blue\"> Debugging Book 3: Statistical Debugging </h2>\n\nAt its core, Statistical Debugging aims to establish a meaningful connection between program failures and specific segments of code. Unlike traditional debugging methods that focus on isolating errors in a deterministic manner, Statistical Debugging embraces the inherent variability in program executions. The process unfolds as follows:\n\n* Collector Class: A critical starting point is the Collector class, responsible for gathering information about each line's execution during program runs. The provided example introduces a basic Collector class from \"The Debugging Book,\" showcasing its potential for customization.\n* Ranking Lines by Suspiciousness: After multiple program runs, the lines of code are ranked based on their suspiciousness. This metric is derived by analyzing which lines were executed during failing runs and comparing them to successful runs. The goal is to identify the lines most likely to cause program failures.\n* Code Coverage Tracking: Understanding what code is being executed is crucial for Statistical Debugging. The CoverageCollector subclass is introduced to track which lines of code are executed and returns a formatted set of tuples with function names and corresponding line numbers.\n* Grouping and Analysis: The collected information is then split based on the outcome (PASS or FAIL). StatisticalDebugger class exemplifies this process, organizing and analyzing the data using different collectors for passing and failing outcomes.\n\nThe approach provides a unique perspective, acknowledging the variability in program executions and leveraging it to identify potential causes of failures. Statistical Debugging empowers developers to analyze a codebase over multiple runs, offering insights that prove especially valuable in large projects where efficiently identifying and resolving bugs is crucial.\n\n As a development team, the decision to incorporate Statistical Debugging into the workflow would require careful consideration. Evaluating the benefits, especially in the context of tools like chasten and cellveyor, will be essential. While the initial implementation may involve a level of complexity, the long-term gains in understanding program behavior and resolving bugs efficiently could prove invaluable, particularly as the codebase continues to evolve and grow in complexity.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"blog.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
