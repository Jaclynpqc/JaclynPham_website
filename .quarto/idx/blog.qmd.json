As we operate on a blame-free environment, we should work on the problem by assigning a group of people to work on fixing the problem in a timely manner. \n* Trade-offs and Costs: We should decide which feature to build, keeping in mind the opportunity cost, technical cost, people cost. etc. \n\n\n## The Fuzzing Book \n\n#### Chapter 1: Introduction to Software Testing\n\nIn the fast-paced world of software development, ensuring the functionality of your programs is immensely important. In this chapter, we'll delve into the fundamentals of software testing.\n\n##### What does Software Testing Mean?\n\nSotware Testing is the process of evaluating a program to identify defects and issues. The purposes of software testing are:\n* Identifying and fixing bugs early in the process\n* Ensuring that the software meets the specified requirements, behaves as expected\n* Reducing the risk of software failures in deployment.\n\n##### Testing Strategies\n\n* **Utilizing 'print()' Statement:** One of the most straightforward yet effective debugging techniques is the 'print' statements. This technique involves strategically printing relevant information that provides information into whether the program is running correctly. \n* **Automatic Test Execution and 'assert()' Statement:** By crafting comprehensive test suites with assert statements, you can systematically check if your code behaves correcly.\n* **Rounding Error: Introducing Epsilon:** Some programs make exact comparisons challengeing by having float type. To tackle this issue, the concept of \"epsilon\" is employed, determining whether two floating-point values are considered equal. Developers often check if the absolute difference between the values of floating-point numbers is less than or equal to epsilon. \n* **Generating Tests: Apply Your Test to Thousands of Inputs:** To increase confidence in your software's correctness (and also reduce the time and effort spend testing each input), consider generating tests with a wide range of inputs. \n* **Integrating Checks:** For robust and reliable code, consider integrating checks directly into your functions. You can utilize Assertions to ensure that the inputs and outputs conform to expected behavior.\n\n##### Applications on Chasten\n\nIt's a collaborative effort to ensure the software run correctly. After reading this chapter, here are some action items I suggest implementing:\n1. Avoid overconfidence in your code and acknowledge that things can go wrong.\n2. Rigorous Testing: To ensure the highest quality of your code, run as many tests as possible. \n3.
