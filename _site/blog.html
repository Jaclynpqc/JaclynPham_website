<p>In previous chapter, we explored the multifaceted role of a software engineer- as an individual, as a team player, as a learner. However, in this chaper, the spotlight shifts to the engineers as a catalyst for change in promoting diversity and inclusivity. The chapter encapsulates this role with a statement: “When engineering does not focus on users of different nationalities, ethnicities, races, genders, ages, socioeconomic statuses, abilities, and belief systems, even the most talented staff will inadvertently fail their users.”. This statement underscore the essence of the software engineer’s responsibility to craft products that resonate with the diverse tapestry of humanity.</p>
<p>This realization ties back to the core purpose of software engineering -to create impactful and useful product that enhance people’s lives. It highlights that the essence of technology progress lies not only in innovation but also in empathy, understanding, and inclusion.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-software-testing-mean">What does Software Testing Mean?</h5>
<p>Software Testing is the process of evaluating a program to identify defects and issues. The purposes of software testing are: * Identifying and fixing bugs early in the process * Ensuring that the software meets the specified requirements, behaves as expected * Reducing the risk of software failures in deployment.</p>
</section>
<section id="testing-strategies" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="testing-strategies">Testing Strategies</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Utilizing ‘print()’ Statement:</strong> One of the most straightforward yet effective debugging techniques is the ‘print’ statements. This technique involves strategically printing relevant information that provides information into whether the program is running correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Test Execution and ‘assert()’ Statement:</strong> By crafting comprehensive test suites with assert statements, you can systematically check if your code behaves correcly.</li>
<li><strong>Rounding Error: Introducing Epsilon:</strong> Some programs make exact comparisons challengeing by having float type. To tackle this issue, the concept of “epsilon” is employed, determining whether two floating-point values are considered equal. Developers often check if the absolute difference between the values of floating-point numbers is less than or equal to epsilon.</li>
<li><strong>Generating Tests: Apply Your Test to Thousands of Inputs:</strong> To increase confidence in your software’s correctness (and also reduce the time and effort spend testing each input), consider generating tests with a wide range of inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Integrating Checks:</strong> For robust and reliable code, consider integrating checks directly into your functions. You can utilize Assertions to ensure that the inputs and outputs conform to expected behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a beginner in programming, I often found myself excited about solcing coding challenges and building software solutions. The satisfation to see my code work sometimes led me to being overconfident in the correctness of my work. After all, if the program executed without immediate errors, it must be fine, right? However, from time to time, I have been proven wrong as I began working on more complex projects. I started to realize that there was more to ensuring the quality and reliability of my code than just making it run. I discovered that power of “nothing as such as being too careful” with program execution and the invaluable role of code coverage. The logic I applied to solve immediate coding problems was crucial, but it was only part of the software development process. The early detection of issues helps me ensure the quality of the program.</p>

Fuzzing Book 5: Mutation-Based Fuzzing
</h2>
<p>Mutation-based fuzzing is a software tesing technique used to discover vulnerabilities or bugs in programs, especially in softwrae that parses complex inputs. Fuzzing involves feedding a program with a large amount of randomly generated or mutated data to trigger unexpected behavior.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Input Generation</strong> - Fuzzer general initial inputs either randomly or from existing valid inputs. These inputs can be in various formats.</li>
<li><strong>Mutation</strong> - Fuzzer mutates mutates the generated inputs to create new,slightly modified inputs. The idea is to explore different way the program approach the bugs to uncover potential vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Input Execution</strong> -The mutated inputs are fed into the target program. The program’s behavior is monitored and analyzed.</li>
<li><strong>Error Detection</strong> -If the program exibits abnormal behavior, the fuzzer detects these errors and logs the input that caused the issue</li>

<h6 class="anchored">Application on Chasten</h6>
<p>Mutation-based fuzzing can be applied to test a software tool that checks XPath expressions, like Chasten, by generating a variety of mutated XPath expressions and feeding them into the tool to uncover potential vulnerabilities. The mutated inputs can start with a set of valid XPath expressions taht the software tool should accept, and then be mutated through different ways, such as delete random character, insert random characters or flip random characters.</p>

<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitaions-of-simple-grammar-fuzzer">Limitaions of Simple Grammar Fuzzer</h6>
<p><code>simple_grammar_fuzzer()</code> can be remarkably inefficient, especially when dealing with large grammars and complex language structures. These inefficiencies become apparent as the function has to iterate over teh generated string, searching for symbols ot expand. Additionally, controlling the output size is problematic, leading to the generation of excessively long strings even with limitations in place.</p>

<section id="the-three-phase-expansion-approach" class="level6">
<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-three-phase-expansion-approach">The Three-Phase Expansion Approach</h6>
<p>To address the limitation of conventional grammar fuzzing, a new approach has been developed, employing a three-phase expansion method encapsulated within a function called <code>expand_tree()</code>.</p>
<p>This approach significantly improves the efficiency of test generation. By organizing the expansion process into well-defined phases, the function efficiently controls the output size and enhances the speed of the test generation process. This method is able to produce smaller inputs, optimizing the testing process further.</p>
</section>
<section id="application-on-chasten-2" class="level6">
<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="application-on-chasten-2">Application on Chasten</h6>
<p>For a tool that checks XPATH expressions, applying the three-phase expansion approach would create a highly efficient testing tool. The expand_tree function can be customized to handle XPATH grammar, enabling the generation of diverse and complex XPATH expressions for testing. By employing this strategy, the tool can quickly explore various parts of the grammar, ensuring comprehensive test coverage. This optimized testing approach not only improves the speed of test generatoin but also enhances the quality of the test cases produced, leading the more robust and reliable XPATH expression checking tools.</p>
